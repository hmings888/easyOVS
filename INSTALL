EasyOVS Installation/Configuration Notes
----------------------------------------

EasyOVS 0.3
---

The supported installation methods for EasyOVS are
1) native installation on common Linux distribution,
such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.
2) Other distributions may be supported in the future - if you would
like to contribute an installation script, we would welcome it!


1. Native installation from source on Ubuntu,Debian,CentOS and Fedora

   If you're reading this, you've probably already done so, but the
   command to download the EasyOVS source code is:

        git clone git://github.com/yeasy/easyovs.git

   If you are running Ubuntu, you may be able to use our handy
   `install.sh` script, which is in `easyovs/util`.

   *WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!*

   To install ALL of the software which is potentially useful software,
   you may use:

        sudo bash easyovs/util/install.sh -a

   The time depends on the network quality and your machine performance.
   This takes about 1 minutes on our test system.

   You can change the directory where the dependencies are installed using
   the -s <directory> flag.

        sudo bash easyovs/util/install.sh -s <directory> -a

2. Installation on other Linux distributions

   Although we don't support other Linux distributions directly, it
   should be possible to install and run EasyOVS with some degree of
   manual effort.

   In general, you must have:

   * Python, `bash`, `git`, `make`, etc.

   * Root privileges (required for network device access)

   We encourage contribution of patches to the `install.sh` script to
   support other Linux distributions.

Good luck!
